This app is a result of Ruby on Rails study with the help of a few sections of Udemy Course [The Complete Ruby on Rails Developer Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-ruby-on-rails-developer-course/) and a large number of helpful articles from the Internet.

It is a simple **desktop** web application like a blog.<br> 
> When we spend time with a cup of favourite hot coffee we are often visited by dreams and inspiring thoughts. This is a place where you can share these memories and feelings with others.
Enjoy this cozy blog.
